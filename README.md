In our college, a common practice followed to keep up and improve the quality of education is by taking feedback from students. This is usually done via the college website or via Google forms. However, the problem that arises is that different forms are floated on different platforms, thereby causing clutter and confusion. Further, as far as students are concerned, once they submit a form, they don’t receive an analysis of their responses automatically, which would help them judge their grasp on the course.
KJSCE Course Feedback Analysis System (CFAS) aims to bring all forms in one platform, thereby solving the problem of clutter and confusion resulting from different forms being floated on different (sometimes external) platforms. Further, it would provide the students with an analysis of each form filled. For each form filled, it would show the total number of “Strongly Agree” selected questions, “Agree” selected questions and so on and display a pie chart based on that, thereby giving the student an idea of his grasp on the course.
In addition to that, the faculty would also receive an analysis for each form. For each course taught by the faculty member, he would have an option to create or edit the form. Once a form is filled by the students, he will be able to see a table wherein all the students who responded would be displayed. Also, for each question, the number of students selecting “Strongly Agree”, “Agree”, etc. will be displayed. Further, a question-wise analysis will be displayed, showing the number of students selecting “Strongly Agree”, etc. for that question. In addition, an overall analysis of the form will be displayed  showing the total number of selections of each option.
